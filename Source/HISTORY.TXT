RTL
V2.0.3.2
- PMWIN.PAS
Added some missing constants to do with frame flags, plus the mouseenter and mouseleave messages which were added for Open32...
V2.0.3.1
- DOS.PAS
Added GetCurrentProcessID function.

- PMSHL.PAS
Corrected declaration of SWBLOCK (tasklist data structure) to be an array of SWENTRYs not just a single one.

SPCC
V2.0.3.7
- EXTCTRLS.PAS
Fixed TRadioGroup so that the item index can be set before the control is visible (eg. on a notebook page that isn't initially visible).
Problem was the code assumed that the control was already visible and that the list of radio buttons had already been created, which is not true until setupshow is run.

V2.0.3.6
- GRAPHICS.PAS
Improved TBitmap.DrawDisabled. Now should properly generate a 50%, pixel by pixel cross hatch, instead of ugly lines.

V2.0.3.5
- FORMS.PAS
Rewrote TCanvas.MnemoTextOut to do the underline of the shortcut char with a line, instead of changing font. It's simpler and looks better. This fixes up many controls such as bitmap button (TBitBtn), tab notebook etc.

Slightly tidied LockDesktopWIndows and InputHook
Also removed a few unused vars

V2.0.3.4
- STDCTRLS.PAS
Fixed libraries bug 14, Combo box does not drop down when edit box clicked on. Picked up the code from FP4, minus the Linux bits; also added DblClick handler, so that double click acts like two seperate clicks (this bit was  not in Fp4).

V2.0.3.3
- STDCTRLS.PAS
Speeded up loading of many items into listbox. This applies to both setup time (when the 'initial items' are put into the actual PM listbox) and if the list is reassigned while being displayed.

This is done by overriding the AddStrings method for TListBoxStrings and calling LoadStrings, which uses the PM message (LM_INSERTMULTITEMS) for loading multiple items into a listbox at once. Up to 20 times faster.

V2.0.3.2
- FORMS.PAS
Properly fixed tasklist handling for modal dialogs. 
Now the existing entries are hidden and restored after the dialog finishes. So, while a modal dialog is showing, there is only one tasklist entry, which correctly refers to the dialog window.

Note this solution is quite different to the "fix" in Speedsoft Fixpack 4. That fix prevented modal dialogs from showing in the tasklist, but the existing entries were left and selecting them still incorrectly focussed the form in question, not the dialog.

Also, the hook that detects clicks on other windows while a modal dialog is showing, now detects mouse button 2 and 3 clicks as well.

V2.0.3.1
- FORMS.PAS
Fixed font dereferencing problem, causing crash after second activation of Font dialog (and probably other problems too).

- SYSUTILS.PAS
Fixed bug 2, additional zero byte written when copying zero terminated strings.
